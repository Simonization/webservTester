# First, compile your webserv project
make

# Run general tests
python3 test_general.py ./webserv config/example.conf

pip3 install psutil


Test Output
The tests provide colored output:

ðŸŸ¢ GREEN: Test passed
ðŸ”´ RED: Test failed
ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW: Warning or skipped
ðŸ”µ BLUE: Section headers

The correction sheet test will indicate if any failure would result in a grade of 0 (like memory leaks or missing I/O multiplexing).
Important Notes

Both test files are designed to work with the actual webserv implementation from your GitHub repository
The tests match the configuration structure in config/example.conf
CGI scripts (lotr.py and star_wars.sh) are tested as found in your project
The correction test specifically checks for mandatory requirements that would result in automatic failure
